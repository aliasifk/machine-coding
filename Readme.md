# Machine Coding Interview Problems and Reusable Boilerplate in Java

Welcome to the **Machine Coding Interview Problems and Reusable Boilerplate in Java** repository! This repository is a collection of machine coding interview problems, their solutions implemented in Java, and reusable boilerplate code for various projects.

## About

This repository serves a dual purpose:

1. **Machine Coding Interview Problems**: It contains machine coding interview problems designed to assess your system design and coding skills. Each problem is organized into its own project directory and includes a `problem.md` file that explains the question, constraints, and expected behavior.

2. **Reusable Boilerplate**: Alongside the interview problems, you'll find reusable boilerplate code and templates for different types of projects. These boilerplate files provide a starting point for your projects, saving you time and effort in setting up the basic structure.

## Contents

This repository includes:

- Well-organized directories for different problem domains, each containing a `problem.md` file.
- Java solutions for various machine coding interview problems.
- Reusable boilerplate code and templates for multiple project types.
- Detailed explanations and comments in the code and boilerplate templates.

## How to Use

1. Browse the different directories to find problems from different problem domains. Each project directory contains a `problem.md` file with the problem description.
2. Navigate to a specific problem to find its Java solution file.
3. Explore the reusable boilerplate directories to find templates for various projects.
4. Clone or fork this repository to use the machine coding problems and boilerplate in your own projects.

## Contributing

We encourage contributions to this repository. If you'd like to add more problems, improve solutions, enhance boilerplate templates, or provide better explanations, your contributions are welcome.

## Disclaimer

The problems, solutions, and boilerplate code provided in this repository are intended for educational purposes and practice. They may not cover all possible edge cases and optimizations that may be required in real-world scenarios.
